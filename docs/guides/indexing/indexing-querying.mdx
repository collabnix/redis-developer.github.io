### Introduction

Conceptually, Redis is based on the key-value database paradigm. Every piece of data is associated with a key, either directly or indirectly. 
If you want to retrieve data based on anything besides the key, youâ€™ll need to implement an index that leverages one of the many data types available in Redis.

You have various ways to create index using Redis core datastructures, for example:

* Sorted sets to create secondary indexes by ID or other numerical fields.
* Sorted sets with lexicographical ranges for creating more advanced secondary indexes, composite indexes and graph traversal indexes.
* Sets for creating random indexes.
* Lists for creating simple iterable indexes and last N items indexes.

When using these datastructures you must create your own API to keep the index up-to-date. To simplify and automate this task, Redis community has created the RediSearch module that allows indexing and querying.

### Indexing and Querying with RediSearch

The easiest way to index and query data in Redis is to use the [RediSearch](http://redisearch.io/) module.

You can follow the [RediSearch Tutorial](https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-getting-started) to learn more about it and look at the following video from Redis University:
