RedisInsight provides built-in support for the RedisJSON, RediSearch, RedisGraph, Redis Streams, and RedisTimeSeries modules to make it even easier to query, visualize, and interactively manipulate search indexes, graphs, streams, and time-series data. Support for RedisJSON on Redis Cluster was introduced for the first time in RedisInsight v1.8.0. With RedisInsight, you can visualize and edit your JSON data flawlessly.
